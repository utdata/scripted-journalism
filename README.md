Scripted Journalism
===================

Beginning notes and such to use scripted journalism techniques in my Reporting with Data class.

## 2010 census pops from csv

STARTED

Scripted version of Excel assignment about formulas. Takes a portion of a Census file and asks to compute percentage of race totals.

## Census demographics from API

IDEA

An idea to use the Census API to do the same lesson as above. I have to figure out the API first.

## Campus accountability ratings

v1 DONE

A lesson on filtering TEA accountability to find failing schools in AISD and Region 13. This is a duplicate of my Excel Pivot Tables lesson.

## Uniform crime reports

An **IDEA** to download UCR reports and replace the charting, multiple sheet lesson from Excel. UCR downlaod sucks.

## UCR crime api explore

An **IDEA** to use the crime data explorer api to replace the charting, multiple sheet lesson from Excel.

## Texas Ethics Commission pivot tables

An **IDEA** to convert the TEC pivot table excercise to agate.
